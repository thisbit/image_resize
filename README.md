# Image Resize
Script adds a simple productivity feature to your workflow if you find yourself having to resize multiple files often. Best used if you add a symlink to your machine so it can be ran from any folder.

> sudo ln -s /path/to/where/the/script/is/located symlinkname

There are many better solutions then this ... but this one is mine. :D Use it or abuse it if you like.
